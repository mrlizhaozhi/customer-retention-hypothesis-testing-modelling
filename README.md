## Components

-  `Plan, Analyze, Construct, Execute`: The `Plan-Analyze-Construct-Execute-PACE.pdf` document leverages the PACE workflow at Google to structure the analytics project. 

**Plan** is where the project is scoped and the goals are defined. **Analyze** is where the data is explored, cleaned, and prepared for analysis. **Construct** is where the hypothesis testing and machine learning models are built. **Execute** is where the results are communicated to stakeholders through dashboards or reports.
