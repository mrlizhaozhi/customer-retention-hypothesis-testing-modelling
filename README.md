# Customer Retention Hypothesis Testing and Modelling (Python)

## Background

This is the capstone of the Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate program offered by [Grow with Google](https://grow.google/certificates/advanced-data-analytics/) via [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/google-certificates/advanced-data-analytics-certificate?utm_source=google&utm_medium=institutions&utm_campaign=sou--direct__med--none-direct__cam--gwgsite__con--null__ter--null&gwg_campaign_id=undefined&gwg_exp=null).

Business scenario:

The [Waze](https://www.waze.com/) navigation app is a popular mobile application that helps users navigate their way around cities. The company has been experiencing a decline in customer retention and wants to understand why this is happening so they can take actionable steps to improve it.

This project is a hypothetical case study that leverages real-world data from Waze to test hypotheses and build machine learning models to predict customer retention.
